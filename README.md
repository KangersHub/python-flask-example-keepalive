# python-flask-example-keepalive


### How it works?

### Basically its just a python flask webserver which can be used to keep any repl/herokuapp or any other services like glitch bla bla etc you need to edit your own code and attach it there in order to make the webserver work.....

### Steps
 - `install or add **flask** in requirements.txt`
 - `make a file called **wserver.py** and paste the contents of **wserver.py** to your repo/code`
 - `find your python start file / the file/folder which starts the app then there **import wserver** it will look like **from wserver import keep_alive**`
 - `in the end line of start file type **keep_alive()**`




## i cant explain everything properly but atleast use your brain to understand the workflow here....

## its not the end after successfully deploying and running the code with webserver you will need to add a pinger/cronjob.......[If you want to keep that app alive....]
